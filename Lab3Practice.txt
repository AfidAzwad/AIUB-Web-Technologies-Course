Assume you are a restaurant who takes orders for food.

Let's say you sell 3 items:

a) Fried Chicken (Price: 150)
b) Double Cheese Burger (Price: 250)
c) Salad (Price: 50)

A customer can order any of these items as much as possible.

If any item is ordered 3 or more times that item's price becomes 80% of its original price.

For example, if someone ordered, 2 (a), 1 (c) and 1 (b), the total price would be = 300 + 50 + 250 = 600.
However, if someone ordered 3(a), 5(c) and a (b), the total price would be = 360 + 200 + 250 = 810

Show the total price of the order after the order button is clicked.

Additional condition:

Customer must order 2 types of foods to complete his order. They cannot only order one type of food from the menu. 
If they do, have some validation in check so that exception can be thrown with a proper error message guiding the customer to order correctly.
